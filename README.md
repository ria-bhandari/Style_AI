# StyleAI

This project uses the Fashion-MNIST dataset to predict the article of clothing given an image.

## Installation

Prerequisites 
- Python 3.6 or higher 

1. Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/ria-bhandari/Style_AI
```

2. Install the required modules using pip

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuring the AI

This project makes use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which is a part of deep learning in Machine Learning.

### AI Model Architecture

•CNN architecture comprising of two 2D convolutional layers (28 and 56 filters), 2x2 max pooling, and fully-connected layers (56 and 10 nodes)

•Used Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss for training (90% accuracy)

•Enhanced knowledge of CNN architectures and AI model training

## Visualization of Fashion-MNIST dataset

To better understand the Fashion-MNIST, visualization was used. 

The first visualization was for the first image in this dataset as follows: <img width="535" alt="Screenshot 2023-10-04 at 9 34 42 AM" src="https://github.com/ria-bhandari/Style_AI/assets/121469289/568fe831-99ab-461d-8e72-a050928ed118">



All the classes in this dataset are:
