This project uses the Fashion-MNIST dataset to predict the article of clothing given an image.

## AI Model Architecture

•CNN architecture comprising of two 2D convolutional layers (28 and 56 filters), 2x2 max pooling, and fully-connected layers (56 and 10 nodes)

•Used Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss for training (90% accuracy)

•Enhanced knowledge of CNN architectures and AI model training
